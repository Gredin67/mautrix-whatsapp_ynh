## Overview
A puppeting bridge between Matrix and WhatsApp packaged as a YunoHost service. Messages, media and notifications are bridged between a whatsapp user and a matrix user. The matrix user can invite other matrix user in a bridged whatsapp room, such that even people without a whatsapp account can participate to whatsapp group conversations. The ["mautrix-whatsapp"](https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-whatsapp/wiki) bridge consists in a synapse app service and relies on postgresql (mysql also available). Therefore, [Synapse for YunoHost](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/synapse_ynh) should be installed beforehand.

**Shipped version:** 1.0

## Limitations

* Audio/Video calls are not bridged yet. It is recommended to install whatsapp on a virtual android running on a server. If whatsapp loses connection, e.g. the phone is set in flight mode, the bot has to be restarted by sending a reconnnect message in the matrix administration room.
